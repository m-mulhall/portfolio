        <h2>My name is Maria Rose Mulhall</h2>
        <p>I am currently a student at the <strong>Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.</strong>
           With a passion for computers, I decided to explore the introductions to software development independently. Still, I desired a more creative path, so I searched for other potentials within the industry, and that is when I discovered User Experience Design. This resulted in me enrolling in SAIT's Interactive Design Diploma, majoring in User Experience.</p>

      <section> 
        <p>before I decided to pursue user experience, I also explored:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Development/Design</li>
          <li>Graphic Design</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
      <p>however, I ultimatley decided on user experience, as it optimizes human interactions between products and services. I have listed below how user experience designers optimize those interactions. Which I find fascinating.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accessibility</li>
        <li>Consistency</li>
        <li>Efficient Design</li>
        <li>Usability</li>
        <li>User Control</li>
        <li>User Research</li>
      </ol>
